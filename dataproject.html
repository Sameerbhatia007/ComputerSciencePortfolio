     This is my Data project about square footage and a real life situation of us house-hunting for the right home perfect square footage an in the right district.
      I figured that If I could help spread the word then people would not spend an extra a $20,000 or more on a bad deal. Or you could be saving up to $30,000. First step is you have to look at the price is the price right or in 
    </p>your budget .If it is then go on to the next step if it isnt then look for a diffrent house 
  .Step 2 Look to see where the home is, is it in the district or where you want it to be? If it is the move onto the next step if it is not than look for a home that fit the district or city you want to be in.
  .Step 3 Scroll down on the home if you've clicked it and find square footage If it is under $130 per/square ft then reconsider the house and look for a difrent house,if it is under $130 per sq foot then go on to step 4.
  Step 4 Connect with a real estate agent (If you scroll down you will find the real estate agent phone numbers) to go look at the house if you like it and It fits your need then go back home and decide with you family and if you have children also consider there thoughts.
